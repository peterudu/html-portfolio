  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>Hello everyone I'm Peter and I live and work in the city of Hamburg in Germany. I was born in Nigeria but I have been
  living in Germany for over 30 years. I enjoy life in Hamburg which is a beautiful and cosmopolitan city. There are many things
  one can enjoy in Hamburg and it is certainly a city worth visiting.</p>

  <p>When I am not working I enjoy reading novels, watching films, listening to Afrobeats music, travelling and getting to know 
  the towns here in Northern Germany as well as those in neighbouring countries around Germany. However my greatest interests at the moment is
  learning web development.</p>

  <p>My future goals include staying healthy, improving my knowledge in web development, getting in contact with other web
  developers and visiting as many countries as possibe</p>
